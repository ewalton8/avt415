		<ol>
			<b><li>Lamp store:</li></b>
			<p>A store that sells cool lamps, they could be artisan lamps and the one page that would sell lamps would ideally sell lamps that all look differently but fit under one theme. For example - animal shaped lamps or food shaped lamps - the theme will depend on what kind of lamps I can find high quality images of. I could do a page about where the materials are sourced from or about the production process</p>
			<b><li>Puzzle store:</li></b>
			<p>The store sells all different kinds of puzzles. There could be a page about the puzzle making process or about different kinds of puzzles. The product page would be different puzzles you can get and each one would have different sizes.</p>
			<b><li>Flower shop:</li></b>
			<p>They sell different flower arrangements. Could be from locally sourced flower gardens with a page about the flower farms they get their flowers from. Another idea for a page could be different kinds of flowers and their meaning in arrangements. The product page would be different arrangements you can buy possibly for a certain holiday.</p>
